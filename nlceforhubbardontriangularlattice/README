"#" in NLCE_1_#.txt file name is the order number, meaning that all the 
clusters listed in NLCE_1_#.txt will have # number of sites.

Here is the structure of each NLCE_1_#.txt file:

- The very first number at the top of each file is simply #, the order
number. It is indicated only for bookkeeping purposes and can be ignored.

- After that the cluster information begins: 
   - The first number in each block is simply the index for the 
     topologically distinct cluster that is represented in that block.
     Indices start from 0 and go up to the total number of such clusters
     in the corresponding NLCE order -1. Each block is separated by 
     a blank line from the next one.

   - The second number in each block is the number of bonds in the 
     cluster (nB). 

   - The next nB lines contain the bond information. They are in the 
     following format: site1, site2, type, where site1 and site2 are 
     the two sites at the two ends of the bond and type is the bond
     type (in the case where we have more than one type, e.g., when 
     n.n.n. bonds are also considered).

   - The number in the line after the bond information is the number 
     of topologically distinct subclusters this cluster has (sc_Num).

   - The next sc_Num lines contain the subcluster information. They 
     are in the following format: m, L, topo idx, where m is the order 
     the subcluster belongs to (the number of sites it has), L is the 
     lattice constant for this subcluster being embedded in the current  
     cluster, and topo idx is the index of the subcluster in order m.

   - The lines after "# Topo. # : Multp" contain lattice constants,
     per site, for each of the preceeding clusters for their embeddings 
     in the lattice in the thermodynamic limit. 

The Python script Part_2_&_3_NLCE_Ehsan_Triangular.py can be called 
to read in these information, up to some order, and calculate NLCE sums
for properties of the Ising model on this lattice geometry.
